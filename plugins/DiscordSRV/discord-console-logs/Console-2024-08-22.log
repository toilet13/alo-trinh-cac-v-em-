Do you like my sword, sword?
Sword, my diamond sword, sword

[Verse 1]
You cannot afford, ‘ford
‘Ford my diamond sword, sword
Even if you could, could
I have a patent!

[Verse 2]
No one else can make a sword
Exactly in this manner, manner
Welcome to my manor, manor
I ca-ca-ca-canna, canna

[Chorus]
Swing, swing, swing my sword, sword
Whenever I get bored, bored
I can swing my sword, sword
I can swing my sword, sword

[Verse 3]
Once I hit the floorboards
But I had it restored
And it was expensive
But it was a write-off!

[Verse 4]
Swinging is my business
And by that I mean swinging swords
Please do not ignore
Do you like my sword?
Ha!

[Verse 5]
That was rhetorical
You know I am the oracle
I know you like my sword
It's made of freakin’ diamonds
If you don't, you're lyin'
But that would be fine
Because it is awesome
And you’re probably jealous!

[Chorus]
I can swing my sword, sword
‘Cause I am the lord, lord
Lord of diamond swords

[Outro: Tobuscus and Gabuscus]
Hahahahaha-
Shut up!
What?
Give it
What?
Gimme the sword
No!
Give it
No, no it's mine!
Nope, nope!
Aww...
Shut up!
I'll see you in court!
Alright
