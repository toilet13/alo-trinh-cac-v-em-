#Hey! For your information, if you have suggestions for other languages, you can write to me on Discord and I will take care of it.
#You can also send me translation errors.
#If you want to help me add new languages, you can write to me on Discord and send me the following things:
#1. The translated txt file. To translate, you can simply use the English.yml.
#2. Say whether you translated it with Google Translate or why you know the language.
#3. Say which language it is.
#4. Thank you :)
